        Cloud computing is a computing paradigm. In this paradigm a large pool of public or private networks are connected. This provides dynamic scalable infrastructure for data and file storage, as well as, applications.
    </p>

    <p class="textSection">
        The result of this technology is application hosting, content storage/delivery and computation cost are greatly reduced. Further resulting in cloud computing a practical approach to direct cost benefits.
    </p>


    <p class="textSection">
        Cloud Providers offer services that can be grouped into three categories, Software as a Service, Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service.

    </p>

    <p class="textSection">
        Software as a Service is highly scalable internet based applications. They are hosted on the cloud and offered as services to the end user. Google Docs, Acrobat.com and Salesforce.com are all Software as a Service providers. Platform as a Service entails a platform used to design, develop, build and test applications that are provided by the cloud infrastructure. Azure Service Platform, Force.com and Google App Engine are Platform as a Service Providers. Infrastructure as a Service is a pay per use model. On demand services such as, storage, database management and compute power are offered on demand. Amazon Web Services, GoGrid and 3 Tera are all Infrastructure as a Service providers.

    <p class="textSection">
        Key advantages of cloud computing can be broken down into Reduced Cost, Increased Storage and Flexibility. There are a number of factors as to why Cloud technology lowers costs. The primary being its billing model, pay as per usage. Infrastructure is not being purchased and lowers the maintenance as the result. Additionally, this lowers the initial expense and the recurring expenses compared to traditional computing.

    </p>

    <p class="textSection">
        Cloud providers today offer massive infrastructure making maintenance and storage of large volumes of data possible. Sudden workload spikes are handled by dynamic scaling. Cloud computing offers the extremely important feature of flexibility.

    </p>

    <p class="textSection">
        With businesses and enterprises having to adapt rapidly to changing business conditions, speed is vital. Cloud computing gets applications to market quickly by using the most appropriate building blocks necessary for deployment.

    <p class="textSection">
        Despite its many advantages concerns still exist about cloud computing. In my opinion the benefits outweigh the drawbacks and the model is worth consideration. We will focus on the drawbacks as follows: Data Protection, Management Capabilities and Regulator Compliance Restrictions.

    </p>



    <p class="textSection">
        Data Security is an immovable element that demands examination. Businesses fear losing their data to competition or worse, the data confidentiality of their consumers. To worsen this, it is often that the actual storage location of the data is not disclosed. In the traditional model enterprises have their own firewalls across data centers to protect this sensitive and valuable information. However, in the cloud model, the service provide would be responsible for data security.
