        The many options in the “as-a-service” cloud computing approaches available all reduce costs and add value.
        Software as a Service, Identity as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Infrastructure as a Service all have a different service capabilities.
        We will examine each approach and determine their strengths.
    </p>

    <p class="textSection">
        Specific attention will be given to Software as a Service. Focus will be given on how each approach adds value to collaboration services like Web mail, messaging, file share and project management. Furthermore, how Identity as a Service integrates with on-premise solutions for human resources, supply chains, and collaboration services in a Software as a Service solution. For the purpose of this research we will examine two global leaders in cloud service providing, Azure and AWS.
    </p>


    <p class="textSection">
        It is commonly accepted that cloud computing approaches reduce costs and add value for enterprises. In fact, everyone seems to be migrating to the Cloud. This is being accomplished through Software as a Service (SaaS), Identity as a Service (IDaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
    </p>

    <p class="textSection">
        Specific attention will be given to Software as a Service and how this model can reduce costs and add value to collaboration services. Additionally we will analyze how an Identity as a Service could integrate with a Software as a Service solution.
        In order to choose the best model for an enterprise we will briefly examine all the aforementioned models.

    <p class="textSection">
        Platform as a Service is the complete deployment and development environment in the cloud. It is broad enough in scope to accommodate anything from apps, to enterprise applications.
    </p>

    <p class="textSection">
        PaaS includes infrastructure but also the middleware. Essentially PaaS was designed to support a complete web application lifecycle. The cost benefits come from avoiding having to buy and manage software licenses and can focus on the applications or services being developed.

    </p>

    <p class="textSection">
        IaaS is less encompassing than PaaS. What IaaS is typically utilized for includes things like test and development, website hosting, storage, backup and recovery, web apps, high-performance computing and big data analysis.
    </p>

    <p class="textSection">
        It is extremely cost effective as it is an instant computing infrastructure that is managed over the internet. IaaS has the ability to quickly scale up or down with demand and you only pay for what you use.
    </p>



    <p class="textSection">
        SaaS is the most encompassing cloud based solution model. SaaS provides the unique attribute of hosting applications as well as all the other models benefits and functions. Chances are, businesses already use a SaaS product daily.
    </p>

    <p class="textSection">
        Web-based services like gmail, outlook and github are all forms of SaaS. With a SaaS solutions we will not need to purchase, install, update or maintain any hardware or software. Furthermore, expensive software such as ERP and CRM applications are now affordable to smaller organizations. An appealing attribute of SaaS is that you only pay for the services and infrastructure you need.
    </p>

    <p class="textSection">
        IDaaS can be integrated into a SaaS provider such as Azure. The benefit of this integration is the use of single sign on to thousands of pre-integrated commercial and custom apps. A few great examples are Office 365, Salesforce.com and ServiceNow.
