    <h3 style="text-align:left;">Lean Thinking</h3>
    <p class="textSection">
        The objective of lean thinking is to improve the company’s productivity and quality of output. Additionally it aims to reduce lead times and reduce resources to support competitiveness and healthy growth. Ideally the outcome of this approach would produce a totally waste free operation that would maximize customer value.

    <h3 style="text-align:left;">
        Value Stream Process Mapping
    </h3>
    <p class="textSection">
        Value stream maps measure the amount of waste and creation of value through the supplier, business, customer chain. In order to do this a value stream map must be made to detail the product flow from the delivery of raw materials and all the steps until the good are ready to ship to the consumer. A value stream map team must consist of a lead team member from each department involved, generally this would entail production, production planning, customer service, supply chain, purchasing, and sales.

    <h3 style="text-align:left;">
        Kaizen
    </h3>
    <p class="textSection">
        Kaizen or continuous improvement is a Lean manufacturing tool that aims to heighten safety, productivity, quality, and workplace culture. Kaizen focuses on small changes that when applied daily result in major improvements over time. A great principle of Kaizen is that everyone from the CEO to the assembly line workers participate and improve the business together. The result of this multi-level effort is humanizing workplaces, waste elimination in the business process, reduction of overly hard work, and increases teamwork.

    <h3 style="text-align:left;">
        Five Ss
    </h3>
    <p class="textSection">
        The Five Ss is a process used to make all the spaces in a work environment productive and efficient. These processes result in benefits like workstation sharing, reduced time spent looking for tools, and workplace improvement. The phases for the Five Ss model are as follows: sorting, straightening, systematic cleaning, standardizing, and sustaining.

    <h3 style="text-align:left;">
        Kanban
    </h3>
    <p class="textSection">
        The core principle behind Kanban is that you can’t get where you want to go without first knowing where you are. Kanban works through an evolutionary change system. The first step is to visualize the work. This materializes in the form of creating a visual workflow model that includes work, bottlenecks, queues, and blocks. The secondary step is to limit the amount of work in process at any given time and to instead focus on a priority system. This leads into the tertiary step of improving the flow of work by analyzing the flow of work.

    <h3 style="text-align:left;">
        Best Fit
    </h3>
    <p class="textSection">
        All process improvement techniques analyzed have their own attractive elements and benefits. There isn't a clear leading among the strategies as they are all effective in their own right.
